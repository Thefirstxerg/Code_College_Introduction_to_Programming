        <p>You are the captain of a spaceship named "The 
   Flying Hippo." One day, you're working on 
   tuning up your ship's engines when you get an 
   urgent message on your space phone:</p>
       <p>"Captain, one of our Mars robots is sick. We need 
   you to go to Mars immediately and retrieve it 
   so that we can fix it and download the results 
   of its important experiments."</p>
   <p>You remember that you're supposed to go to a meeting 
    of the Space Scouts tonight, and you were 
    really looking forward to it. But, on the other 
    hand, the other Space Scouts would understand 
    that this mission is very important.</p>
        <p>What do you do? Go to Mars, or stay home?</p>
